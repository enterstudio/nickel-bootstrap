## Where to start

I've picked some directories for holding files, but nickel is hot off the press, things haven't stabilized yet.

* I put my mustache templates in [templates](https://github.com/ninjabear/nickel-bootstrap/tree/master/templates)
* I put my static files in [public](https://github.com/ninjabear/nickel-bootstrap/tree/master/public)
* Routes are configured in [src/main.rs](https://github.com/ninjabear/nickel-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main.rs)
